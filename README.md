# HNSCC_project

## Subject for project repo
Mainly for easy access on several devices for myself, but also for inspiration for
how to work with your sequencing data, using pandas dataframes, and getting gene-annotation data
from databanks via API, in this case ENSEMBL.
Later on I will share the resulting publication and graph and modelling techniques.
The ENSEMBL archived data retrieval framework in perl is not mine, but the module retrieving name and description data from IDs using Perl and Python is written by me.
